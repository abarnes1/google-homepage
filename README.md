This is the Google homepage project created as part of The Odin Project.  I had to make heavy use of the css flexbox (and flexboxes in flexboxes) and divs of varying heights and widths to achieve a similar layout.  A lot can be done with layered flexboxes.  I've seen their power.

Margin and padding let me fine tune spacing on sections of the overall layout, like the navigation and footer bars, to achieve a more visually pleasing page.  Fonts and some hover effects also add to the page's overall visual appeal.

It was not required for this project, but I did get to use flex-wrap and media queries to make the footer responsive to different screen widths.  It's the coolest part of the page although it interferes with the search input and buttons if the screen gets *too* small.
